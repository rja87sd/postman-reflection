## Day 1 Assignment
In Postman, the API shows the name of the Pokemon, a list of its abilities, whether or not the abilities are hidden, and a list of other statistics like which game the Pokemon appeared in and its Pokedex number as of that game, what moves it can learn and what level it can unlock them at. It shows all of this in JSON format, making it easy to retrieve the data as needed by the application. There are even different text formats available to the user in Postman, like Pretty, Raw, etc. I chose Charmander, Charmeleon, and Charizard because dragons are my favorite type of fictional creature.
